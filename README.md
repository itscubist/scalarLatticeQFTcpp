# scalarLatticeQFTcpp
Lattice Monte Carlo for Scalar Boson QFT with quartic interaction in 2-3-4 space-time dimensions. Ising model like single cluster algorithm for the sign of the field at each location. An additional update for the magnitude of the field at each lattice site. Periodic boundary conditions are applied.
